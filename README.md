# Onionskin Studio

This project is a desktop program for Windows, Linux, and MacOS for creating simple
hand-drawn animations. The goal of this program is to emulate the feeling of animating using pen and
paper while providing useful tools to empower users to create whatever they choose.
Ease of use will be accomplished by providing a small number of tools that perform their own
specific actions. Users will be able to select a preferred tool through an easy-to-understand GUI. Planned
tools include pencils, fill tools, and selectors.
## Benefits
- Alternative 2D animation software abstracts the traditional animation process. This project will
provide an experience closer to drawing on physical paper.
- Other 2D animation software tend to have complicated GUIs that slow down the animator. This
project will provide a simple GUI without unnecessary nested menus.
## Planned Features
- Many colors from which to choose
- Tools such as pencils, a paint bucket, and selectors
- Transparency for drawing tools and overlays
- Onion-skinning support, providing an afterimage of what was drawn on previous frames
